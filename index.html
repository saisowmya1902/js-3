<h2 id="para">Childhood in the three categories Early,Middle,Preadolescence</h2>
<h4 id="h1"><mark>Early</mark> childhood follows the infancy stage and begins with toddlerhood when the child begins speaking or taking steps independently.
While toddlerhood ends around age 3 when the child becomes less dependent on parental assistance for basic needs, early childhood 
continues approximately until the age of 5 or 6. However, according to the National Association for the Education of Young Children, 
early childhood also includes infancy. At this stage children are learning through observing, experimenting and communicating with others.
Adults supervise and support the development process of the child, which then will lead to the child's autonomy. Also during this stage,
a strong emotional bond is created between the child and the care providers. The children also start preschool and kindergarten at
this age: and hence their social lives.</h4>
<p>During <mark>Middle </mark>childhood, children enter the school years, where they are presented with a different setting than they are used to. 
This new setting creates new challenges and faces for children</p>
<p><mark>Preadolescence</mark> is a stage of human development following early childhood and preceding adolescence. Preadolescence is commonly defined 
as ages 9â€“12, ending with the major onset of puberty, with markers such as menarche, spermarche, and the peak of height velocity occurring.
These changes usually occur between ages 11-14. It may also be defined as the 2-year period before the major onset of puberty.</p>
